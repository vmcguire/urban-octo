# Horiseon SEO Digital Marketing (urban-octo)

## Horiseon Landing Page for Clients to See Offers and Benefits

The purpose of this project was to Refractor the code to make it accessible to all people that might visit the site to include any visually impaired visitors. 

We wanted to make this a very descriptive experience. The best way to showcase Horiseon's digital marketing skills is to have good digital marketing with their own site. We hope to achieve just that with our code. 

We learned that its possible to make a website great but to always include and be aware of anyone that could be accessing the site. We also learned some great tactics to organize the flow of the code and to reduce any repetitive instructions to minimize of any maintenance burden in the future.
